## Unit 19 React Homework: Employee Directory
  This assignment was to create an employee directory with React. In this assignment I broke up the application's UI into components, managed component state, and responded to user events. The user is able to sort the table of employees by at least one category and filter the users by at least one property.

### Search Bar
  The screenshot below shows the 'filterName' function that filters the employees by their name. The function always filters from the array of data, rather than from the new array it is getting from filter.

### Name Button
  The screenshot below shows the function that sorts through the employee names and puts them in alphabetical order.

### Methods Called
  The screenshot below shows the functions mentioned above being called. 'filterName' is called in 'Search', so as the user begins typing an employees name the data will filter for that employee. 'sort'
is being called inside of 'Button' the function runs when the user clicks the button by the name coulmn.

  The gif below shows the working application. When the user searches for an employee as they type it sorts through the employees. When the user clicks the button by name, the emplyees are sorted in alphabetical order by their name.
